**Problem Statement ID** - 1449 <br><br>
**Problem Statement Title** <br>
Design, develop and implement a software bill of materials (SBOM) generation tool that can generate the complete SBOM of custom-developed software (including in-house developments by organisations)<br><br>
**Description**	<br>
SBOM stands for Software Bill of Material and lists out all the packages / modules used from various repositories to make the final solution. This list is essential for identification of vulnerabilities that may impact the final solution. This is critical for supply chain vulnerability management of solutions deployed within the organisation. Thus the task for developers is to develop a software which automatically lists various libraries, dependencies and modules that have been used for making of a given application and generates underlying SBOM. There would be added focus on creating features which can red flag anomalies with an ability to lay out the context to the user. The evaluation shall be based on automation, granularity and accuracy of the SBOM generated. Example, if the developer can identify the version of the libraries used, it shall be graded higher. Ease of use and user experience are other important metrics of evaluation.<br><br>
